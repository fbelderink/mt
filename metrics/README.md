# Metrics

### Structure: 
[metrics.py](./metrics.py) contains our implementation of the metrics described in the lecture and therefore our solution to the first tasks of assignment 01.
It is mostly meant as a source file to be imported in other scripts.

[corpus_statistics.sh](../eval/corpus_statistics.sh) is a bash script that calculates the relevant corpus statistics as described in task 01 of assignment 01. 
It uses the first positional argument as the path to the corpus file and the second positional argument as a precision value for the floating point numbers in the output.
